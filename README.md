-> This website has been created to overcome the problem of class updates.
-> Since the technology is moving towards mobile devices, so this website has been made mobile friendly.
-> This website is very simple with some minor security issues.
-> There are few issues in this which need to be fixed such as:
   * New line cant be inserted.
   * When link is posted, it has to be pasted to the address instead of directly clicking on it.
   * The update page needs to have a basic editor which has the functionality such as Bold,Italic,Colored Labels etc.
-> For security reasons password encrypt file has been removed.
-> Database has been removed.
